# Immortal ü•ä

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)

> A Web3 + AI-powered quiz arena battle game

## üèÜ Project Overview

Immortal is a Web3 + AI-powered quiz battle game styled like boxing matches. Users can participate in quiz duels or cheer for contestants as audience members. When contestants answer incorrectly consecutively, audience members can even replace them on stage to continue the battle. All match results are permanently recorded on the blockchain, achieving true "immortality."

**This project was developed for the Shenzhen Monad Hackathon with only one day of development time, primarily focused on validating core concepts and UI implementation.**

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üéÆ Game Modes
- **I Want to Battle**: Enter the candidate pool and wait to be selected for arena duels
- **I Want to Cheer**: Choose a seat in the audience area to cheer for contestants on stage

### ü§ñ AI Referee System
- AI robot automatically generates questions (multiple choice, 10 questions per match)
- AI judges answer correctness
- AI selects the final winner

### üî• Audience Interaction
- Audience can clap and cheer in real-time, increasing heat levels
- Higher heat levels create cooler avatar effects (glowing red effects)
- When contestants answer 3 questions wrong consecutively, the audience member with the highest heat level can replace them on stage

### ‚õìÔ∏è Immortal Chain System
- All match results are permanently recorded on the blockchain
- Winner information is "carved" into blocks and added to the Immortal Chain
- Demonstrates the immutable characteristics of blockchain technology

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Blockchain Framework**: Scaffold-ETH 2
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity + Hardhat
- **Web3 Libraries**: RainbowKit + Wagmi
- **Development Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Vaporwave + Cyberpunk style)
- **Deployment Network**: Monad Testnet
